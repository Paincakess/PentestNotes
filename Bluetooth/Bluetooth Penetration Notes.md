# Bluetooth Basics
- Operates at 2.4 -2.485 GHz using speed spectrum.
- Frequency hopping at 1600 hops per second.
- The minimum specification for Bluetooth range is 10 meters.

## Bluetooth Pairing
- Nearly any two Bluetooth devices can connect to each other.
- Any discoverable Bluetooth device transmits the following information:
	- Name
	- Class
	- List of Service
	- Technical Information
- When the two devices pair, they exchange a pre-shared secret or link key. Each stores this link key to identify the other in future pairing.
- Every device has a unique 48-bit identifier (a MAC-like address) and usually a manufacturer assigned name.

# Basic Linux Bluetooth Tool
- The Linux implementation of the Bluetooth protocol stack is [BlueZ](http://www.bluez.org)
- **BlueZ** has a number of simple tools we can use to manage and eventually hack Bluetooth, which includes
	- **hciconfig** - Operates similar to **ifconfig** in Linux, except that operates on Bluetooth Device
	- **hcitool** - Used for inquiry which can provide device name, device ID, device class.
	- **hcidump** - This tool enables us to sniff the Bluetooth communication.

# Bluetooth Security 
- **Three Security modes for Bluetooth**
	- **Security Mode 1** - No active Security
	- **Security Mode 2** - Service level security. Centralized security manager handles authentication, configuration, and authorization.
	- **Secuirty Mode 3** - Device level security. Authentication and encryption based on secret key. Always on. Enforces security for low-level connection.

# Some Basic Bluetooth Hacking Tools
- **BlueLog** 
	- Download: https://github.com/MS3FGX/Bluelog
	- A bluetooth site survey tool. It scans the area to find as many discoverable devices in the area and then logs them to a file.
- **Bluemaho**
	- Download: https://github.com/zenware/bluemaho
	- A GUI-based suite of tools for testing the security of Bluetooth devices.
- **BlueRanger** 
	- Download: https://github.com/GIJack/BlueRanger
	- A simple Python script that uses i2cap pings to locate Bluetooth devices and determine their approximate distances.
 -  **BTscanner** 
	 -  Download: `sudo apt install btscanner`
	 -  This GUI-based tool scans for discoverable devices within range.
- **Redfang**
	- Download: https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/redfang/
	- This tool enables us to find hidden Bluetooth device.
- **Spooftooph**
	- Download: `sudo apt install spooftooph`
	- This is a Bluetooth spoofing tool.

# Bluetooth Attacks
- **BluePrinting** 
	- Blueprinting is a method to remotely find out details about bluetooth-enabled devices. 
	- Blueprinting can be used for generating statistics about manufacturers and models and to find out whether there are devices in range that have issues with Bluetooth security.

- **Bluesnarfing**
	- This attack takes data from the Bluetooth-enabled device. This can include SMS messages, calendar info, images, the phone book, and chats.

- **Bluebugging**
	- The attacker is able to take control of the target's phone. [Bloover](https://trifinite.org/stuff/blooover/) was developed as a POC tool for this purpose.

- **BlueJacking**
	- The attacker sends a "business card" (text message) that, if the user allows to be added to their contact list, enables the attacker to continue to send additional messages.

- **Bluesmack**
	- A DoS attack against Bluetooth devices.
