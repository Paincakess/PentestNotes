# Servers
- **C2 Severs** - Used by attackers to maintain communication with compromised system within a target network.
- **Payload Servers** - This is a dedicated server hosting all the malicious scripts, executables etc, which is accessible from both attackers and victim network.
- **Redirector Servers** - A redirector is a system that proxies all traffic to your C2 server.

> Attackers Doesn'tz use one system to launch attacks and get shells, They setup multiple systems to act as pivot points (redirectors) back to their C2 servers.


# Networks
- **De-Militarized Zone Network (DMZ Network)**:
	- A physical or logical Network used to connect hosts that provide interface to an untrusted external network.
	- This system are most vulnerable to attacks those provide services to users outside of the local area network, such as e-mail, Web and DNS are present inside a DMZ
	- The main goal of a DMZ is to access resources from untrusted networks while keeping the private Network Secured.
- **Militarized Zone Network (MZ Network)**:
	- Zone having maximum security and is one of the most secure segment un the environment.
	- Contains critical information about the organizations etc.
	- All important operations in the organizations is managed from Militarized network.

# Exploits
- **Singles**
	- These are self-contained payload assigned to do a specific task that is, create a user, or a bind shell.
	- Example: *payload/windows/adduser*
- **Stagers**
	- These type are payload are used to download large payload to the target machine from the attacker machine.
	- Creates a network connection between attackers & compromised machine.
	- Example: *payload/windows/shell/bind_tcp*
- **Stages**
	- These are the large downloaded by the stagers & then executed.
	- Assigend to complex tasks liek Remote Desktop, meterpreter etc.
	- Example: *payload/windows/shell/bind_tcp*
- **Shells**
	- They are mon-GUI interaction with the system, one can interact & manage the environment of the system through shell.
	- Examples:
		- In Windows:
			- Command Prompt & PowerShell
		- In Linux:
			- Bash & sh Shells

# Technologies Exploitation
- **Web Technology**
	- Knowledge of OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities should be known.
	- We may encounter Scenarios where we need to perform custom Web exploitation (Chaining of Vulnerabilities).
	-  Identification of Target's environment specifically for identification of web technologies are needed.
- **Network Technology**:
	- Understanding of Network devices like routers, switches, servers, computers etc and network protocols in use at enterprise network.
	- Mapping of users with their allotted systems, internal network architecture must be cleared before attacking phase.
	- We will be hunting for open TCP/UDP ports having some remote access services, unpatched/vulnerable services, to maintain initial foothold.
	- Latest/Unstable software accessible over web or network have higher chance of in-built vulnerabilities.
-   **Cloud Technology**:
	- Cloud Technology have on-demand availability with very feasible computing resources and hence are first choice for organization.
	- Cloud services like Amazon Web Services (**AWS**), Microsoft **Azure** and Google Cloud Platform (**GCP**) are deployed in large scale demanding skilled Administrator.
	- A tiny mistake/misconfiguration from administrator leave a big open door for attacker for example Identity and Access Management (**IAM**) of employees.
	-  Organization on-premises network is directly connected with cloud services (door to internal network)
- **Physical Technology**:
	- Instead of relying on tool-based approaches, a Red Team Develops unique attack situation leveraging manual and automated procedures.
	- Red teams are trained to elude detection from one or more of the following security devices:
		- CCTVs
		- Keypad Entry locks
		- Wireless Intercoms/Video intercoms
		- Motion/Sensor Detector
		- Door and Window locks
		- Remote entry gates
- **Wireless Technologies**
	- The massive rise in cyberattacks via public Wi-Fi networks, open enterprise Wi-Fi campus connected to internal network possess a huge threat.
	- Common Wireless Vulnerabilities:
		- Use of Default SSIDs and Passwords
		- Downgrading the wireless security protocol to WEP and to the older WPA version.
		- WPA2 Krack Vulnerability 
		- FAke WiFi Access Points, Evil Twins, and  Man in the Middle Attacks.
		- Packet sniffing 
		- MAC spoofing
