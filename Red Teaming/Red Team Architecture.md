# Servers
- **C2 Severs** - Used by attackers to maintain communication with compromised system within a target network.
- **Payload Servers** - This is a dedicated server hosting all the malicious scripts, executables etc, which is accessible from both attackers and victim network.
- **Redirector Servers** - A redirector is a system that proxies all traffic to your C2 server.

> Attackers Doesnt use one system to launch attacks and get shells, They setup multiple systems to act as pivot points (redirectors) back to their C2 servers.


# Networks
- **De-Militarized Zone Network (DMZ Network)**:
	- A physical or logical Network used to connect hosts that provide interface to an untrusted external network.
	- This system are most vulnerable to attacks those provide services to users outside of the local area network, such as e-mail, Web and DNS are present inside a DMZ
	- The main goal of a DMZ is to access resources from untrusted networks while keeping the private Network Secured.
- **Militarized Zone Network (MZ Network)**:
	- Zone having maximum security and is one of the most secure segment un the environment.
	- Contains critical information about the organizations etc.
	- All important operations in the organizations is managed from Militarized network.

# Exploits
- **Singles**
	- These are self-contained payload assigned to do a specific task that is, create a user, or a bind shell.
	- Example: *payload/windows/adduser*
- **Stagers**
	- These type are payload are used to download large payload to the target machine from the attacker machine.
	- Creates a network connection between attackers & compromised machine.
	- Example: *payload/windows/shell/bind_tcp*
- **Stages**
	- These are the large downloaded by the stagers & then executed.
	- Assigend to complex tasks liek Remote Desktop, meterpreter etc.
	- Example: *payload/windows/shell/bind_tcp*
- **Shells**
	- They are mon-GUI interaction with the system, one can interact & manage the environment of the system through shell.
	- Examples:
		- In Windows:
			- Command Prompt & PowerShell
		- In Linux:
			- Bash & sh Shells
