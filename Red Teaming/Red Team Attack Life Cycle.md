# Red Team Attack Life Cycle
1. **Extensive OSINT**
	- Gathering more and more information about the target.
	- Social Media sites, Platforms where employees are generally active are primary focus.
	- Tons of information are available in the internet, from there sensitive ones can be used for further exploitation purposes. 
2. **Initial Access & Execution**
	- Initial access consists of entry vectors for gaining access with the internal network.
	- Exploitation to external Remote Services, mis-configurations in Web applications can lead to the internal network.
	- Ways of getting initial access depends on the technologies used by the target which can be identified from OSINT.
3. **Persistence & Privilege Escalation**
	- Look for hidden techniques to keep access to the system across restarts, changed credentials etc.
	- Escalating privilege to higher-level permissions on a system or network. Some common approaches are exploiting system weakness, misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.
		- **Elevated Access Accounts**:-
			- SYSTEM/root level users
			- Local Administrators
			- User with admin privilege
			- Privileged groups etc.
4. **Lateral Movement with Defensive Evasion**
	- Lateral movement from gaining access of one assets within a network to other devices within the network.
	- Attackers can use their own remote access tools for accomplishing Lateral movement or using legit credentials with native network and  OS tools, which is more stealthier.
	- Example:
		- **Internal Phishing**: Attackers may use internal phishing to gain access to additional information or exploit other users within the same organization after they already have access to accounts or systems within the network.
		-  **Remote Services**: Threat attackers may use valid credentials to login in services liek SSH, VNC, RDP and so on.
	- Defensive Evasion deals with avoiding detection throughout the compromise.
	- AV detection can be obfuscated using malicious scripts, hiding in trusted processes and disabling security software etc. 
	- Defensive Evasion benefits from discovery but is more related to understanding how attacker avoid network defenders, whether through certain process or knowing which security tools are on a system.
	- [Impair Defenses](https://github.com/pmarella2/Impair-Defenses-MSDefATP) tool disables Firewalls and Antivirus and detection capabilities that defenders can use to audit and identify malicious behavior. 
5. **Discovery & Data Collection**
	- Data collection is the process of gathering and measuring information established system.
	- The data collected can be sensitive information present in a System/Network.
	- Example:
		- Archive Collected Data: An attacker may compress and encrypt data that is collected prior to exfiltration.
		- Clipboard Data: Attackers can collect data stored in the clipboard from copying information within or between the applications.
6. **Data Exfiltration & High-level Persistence**   
	- Once all the critical data has been identifies and packed, attackers will try to steal data from the computer/Network.
	- Attackers can also compress and encrypt the collected data.
	- This can be done my using automated exfiltration tools to exfiltrate data gathered during collection or physically with the help of removable drive.
