# Firewall Policies
Any traffic going through a FortiGate unit has to be associated with a policy. These policies are essentially discrete compartmentalized sets of instructions that control the traffic flow going through the firewall. These instructions control where the traffic goes, how it’s processed, if it’s processed and even whether or not it’s allowed to pass through the FortiGate. 

When the firewall receives a connection packet. it will,
- Analyze Source address
- Analyze Destination address
- Analyze Service (through port number)
- Registers the incoming interface and outgoing interface it used
- Logs the time of the day.

Analyzing the information above FortiGate firewall attempts to locate a security policies that matches the packet. The two basic actions that the initial connection are either **ACCEPT** or **DENY**. If no security policy matches the traffic, the packets are **dropped**.

- **ACCEPT POLICY** permits communication sessions, also contains packet processing instructions such as requiring authentication to use the policy or restrictions on the source and destination of the traffic.
- **DENY POLICY** blocks the communication sessions and also logs the denied traffic for more detailed inspection. The deny security policy is needed when it is required to log the **denied traffic** aka **violation traffic**.

There are two other actions associated with the policy which are **LEARN** and **IPsec**
- **LEARN** is specialized variation of the **ACCEPT** action which is set up to allow traffic but to keep traffic logs so that the administrator can learn what kind of traffic has to be dealt with. 
- **IPsec** is also an **ACCEPT** action that is specifically for IPsec VPNs.
